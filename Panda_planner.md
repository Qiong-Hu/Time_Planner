## Tips on having your happiest year yet
- Def happiness

	1. Intellectual well-being
	1. Relational well-being
	1. Emotional well-being
- Happiness (cause) -> Success (effect)
	- instead of the reverse
	- because the experience of pleasurable emotions leads to higher levels of creativity, increased motivation, better relationships, and a stronger immune system.
	- Happiness contributes in significant, meaningful, and positive ways to our personal and professional lives.
- Important keys to happiness
	- Giving / taking care of others
	- Taking care of ourselves: e.g. regular physical exercise (> 30 minutes three times a week)
	- Expressing gratitude, through a gratitude journal or by sharing what we appreciate around the dinner table
	- Curiosity and ongoing learning: e.g. ten minutes of mindfulness practice a day
- Tips to implement meaningful changes
	- rely on rituals, on habits
	- rather than on willpower and self-discipline
- Top tips for building habits to create lasting change
	1. Reminders
		- External cues in our environment that focus our attention on a particular commitment we made
	1. Repetition
	1. Rituals
- First step to take to be happier this year
	- Open ourselves up to painful emotions, whether sadness, frustration, envy, or fear.
	- need to allow in unhappiness before fully experience happiness
	- painful emotions and pleasurable emotions - unhappiness and happiness - are two sides of the same coin
	- need to give ourselves the permission to be human, to experience any and all emotions
	- Invest in your relationships.


## How to set a new year's resolution that actually works
1. Define your goal
	> To advance further on the way from wishes to action, individuals reflect and decide on when, where, how, and how long to act, thus creating plans for action. —— Dr. Peter Gollwitzer
	1. Start with a vague wish, e.g. eat healthier
	1. Shape this goal into sth that fits both your abilities and ambitions / realistic
	1. Define a timeline and choose some way to measure the progress
	1. Tap into your why or your long-term motivation driving this goal. Paint a vivid picture of why this goal is important for you and your future.
1. Start small
	> When you do a behavior and feel a positive emotion about it, your brain pays attention. It essentially thinks, "Wow, that felt good. I want to do that behavior again!" —— Dr. BJ Fogg
	1. Shrink the goal down. Start really small. e.g. reducing your target from a veggie in every meal to once a week
	1. Map out a series of milestones that gradually build toward the final goal
1. Prepare for trouble
	- prepare for the barriers to change
	1. Use an "If - then" plan
		- Expect the likely obstacle and creating a specific plan ahead of time
		- pro: takes off the pressure off you in the moment, so you stay calm and stck to your goal
	1. Replace a bad habit with a good one
		- Making a clean swap between the bad habit and a positive habit
1. Refine through trial and error
	- Paying attention and recorrecting if things aren't working
	- Start by tallying up your progress at the end of every day and week. The secret is to analyze your behavior to improve your chances for success.
1. Revisit your *why* often
	- Zoom out to look at the big picture and remind yourself why you're putting in the work
	1. Meditation
	1. Visualization


## SMART goals
1. Specific
	- Define your goal as precisely as possible
	- quantify if possible
	- identify precisely what you're aiming for
1. Measurable
	- don't involve too much numbers when measuring
	- involve a quick tally at the end of the day or week, and a range of acceptable final ourcomes for some flexibility
1. Attainable
	- Give yourself a realistic (and probably incremental) goal
	- think about your real life instead of a perfect one
1. Relevant
	- to stay motivated, make it overwhelmingly clear why this goal is important to you. 
	- take a step back to look at the big picture: a long-term vision of how the future will be better if you achieve this goal
1. Time-bound
	- Set a time limit that makes sense for this goal
	- provide a clear finish line to aim for that doubles as a built-in checkpoint for assessing your progress later on
	- the motivational boost from a healthy dose of time pressure helps, too

		- time-limited, task-focused activity
	1. Practice gratitude
		- daily gratitude journal (using Panda Planner)
1. in professional life
